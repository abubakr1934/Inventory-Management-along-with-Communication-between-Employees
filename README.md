# Inventory-Management-along-with-Communication-between-Employees

**Description:**
This project is an Inventory Management System designed to track and manage different types of items in a warehouse or store. It employs various design patterns for efficient communication, organization, and maintenance of inventory.

**Key Features:**
Factory Method Pattern: Facilitates the creation of different inventory items such as products and equipment.
Mediator Pattern: Enables communication between employees when an item's quantity becomes zero without direct references among them.
Observer Pattern: Notifies observers, such as managers or logging systems, about inventory updates and alerts for low inventory.
Command Pattern: Implements commands for updating the inventory, adding or removing items, and notifying observers.
**Functionality:**
Inventory Tracking: Tracks item quantities, manages incoming and outgoing stock, and alerts employees about low inventory levels.
Employee Communication: Notifies employees through a mediator when an item's quantity reaches zero, prompting action for restocking or updates.
Observer Notifications: Alerts managers or designated observers about inventory updates or low stock situations.
Dynamic Item Management: Allows for the addition, removal, and update of different inventory items.
**Technologies Used:**
**Language: Java
Design Patterns: Factory Method, Mediator, Observer, Command**
